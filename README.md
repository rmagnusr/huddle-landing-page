### What I learned

I learned how somethime we can spend a lot of time to solve something that we think is hard, but when we look other way, we reallize that the answer is very simple, how happened with me when try to put a background color here in diferent ways before try the simple. 

```body {
  background:url("../images/bg-desktop.svg") no-repeat left top fixed;
  background-color: hsl(257, 40%, 49%);
  ```

### Continued development

Everytime I practice some content that I think I already now, I learn so much. So I need keep practicing more and more.
